                About Starter Motor</h1>
            
            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">A car starter motor is an electric motor. It starts the car engine. It is made up of two parts one is A DC electric motor (Direct Current) and other is called a starter solenoid. The second part is attached to the motor itself. The car's battery supplies power to the starter motor. For turning on the engine or starting the car the starter motor is the most important part.  It also need very high voltage electric current. For this purpose, the battery should have enough power.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><p>It is very common for cars to experience starting trouble. It should be noted that not all such troubles are caused by a failing starter motor. It is necessary to get the entire starting system or the starter motor circuit of the car should be tested.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The starter motor not working or starting system problems are common and not all problems are caused by a faulty starter motor. To find the cause of the problem the starting system must be properly tested. read more below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>The starter Solenoid</strong></p><p>•	Its main job is to carry forward the transmission of electric current
</p><p>•	On starting it closes down the electric circuit and transmits the battery current to the starter motor
</p><p>•	It works as a mechanism also at this same moment. It pushes the starter gear forward to mesh with flex plate ring gear teeth of the car engine
</p><p>Parts of the starter solenoid:
</p><p>For the control wire, a small connector plus two large terminals among which one is for the starter motor and the other is meant for the positive battery cable 
</p><p><strong>The Battery cables</strong></p><p>1.	Thick large cables for connection with the battery.  Because the to start the engine the starter motor need a very high power electric current.
</p><p>2.	The "-" ground or negative cable: its job is to connect engine cylinder block with the battery terminal. This is located close to the starter
</p><p>3.	The starter solenoid is connected by the positive cable to the positive ("+") battery terminal 
</p><p><strong>Functioning of the starting system</strong></p><p>When you start the car by turning the ignition key the voltages from the battery passes through the starter control circuit. This, in turn, activates the Starter Solenoid. In the next step, the starter motor gets energized. Now, this solenoid comes into more action and pushes the starter gear forward. This meshes the gear with the flywheel or flexplate of the engine. The flywheel is mostly attached to the crankshaft. This results in spinning motion of the starter motor which starts turning the engine crankshaft over. At the completion of this process, the engine starts.
</p><p><strong>Some causes of starter motor problems are as under</strong></p><p>•	Defects of the starter motor itself
</p><p>•	Wire defects: Poor Wiring Connection
</p><p>•	Solenoid Defect
</p><p>•	Poor Earthing
</p><p>•	Ignition Switch Defect
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Troubleshooting Starter Motor Problems</strong></span></p><p>•	First of all, car owners/drivers should know that cranking the starter of longer time is very dangerous for your car. If your car engine does not start in 30 seconds do not make haste. Wait for some more 30 seconds. This pause prevents overheating or damaging the car starter. 
</p><p>Noise at the time of cranking</p><p>If your starter creates noise at the time of cranking it could be mostly because of the improper engagement between the pinion of the starter and the ring gear of the flywheel.
</p><p>Troubleshooting this noise</p><p>•	Realign by loosening the mounting bolts of the starter if needed. Remember loosely mounted bolts can again produce noise so tighten them properly
</p><p>•	Worn torn starter pinion or flywheel ring gear teeth can also produce noise
</p><p>•	Mounting shims should be checked again for their correct number and proper positioning
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The replacement starter misalignment</strong></p><p>•	It could be because of the malfunctioning of the replacement starter. During installation or transportation, the clutch might have got damaged. 
</p><p>
F<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">ree spinning movement of the car starter&nbsp;</span></p><p>In case of free spinning replacement starter, it could be because of misalignment of the new starter or wrong meshing of flywheel ring gear and the pinion. So check again and realign as necessary. There could be broken teeth of ring gear or pinion. If needed try to replace the teeth. 
</p><p>A worn torn starter drive:  remove it from the car. Power it with jumper cables to find out whether it properly moves the pinion gear into cranking position. Also, it might be necessary to check for a faulty starter drive. Remove the starter from the vehicle and energize it with jumper cables to determine if the starter drive is properly moving the pinion gear into the cranking position. If it engages and cranks the engine, then again skips and spins freely, it could be because of the following two conditions: 
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Slow Crank Condition</strong></p><p>•	Check the circuit for worn-out or broken, burnt wires
</p><p>•	Loose or corroded battery terminals
</p><p>•	Lack of voltage reaching the car starter motor
</p><p>•	Battery need recharge 
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>No Crank condition of car starter</strong></p><p>•	At the time of turning your car's ignition key if a click or chatter like noise is heard it could be because of a dead or weak battery. So, think of replacing or recharging the battery.  
</p><p>•	If you get no sound at all when trying to start the engine, the starter motor is not receiving any voltage. Check the battery and all wires/connections. Then evaluate the starter circuit for voltage drops.
</p><p>How to install a new car starter?
</p><p>1.	Compare the new one with the old one
</p><p>2.	Slide the new one into its place
</p><p>3.	Insert the starter retainer bolts
</p><p>4.	Connect the wiring to the starter solenoid
</p><p>5.	Reconnect the battery
