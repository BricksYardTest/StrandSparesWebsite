                About AC Compressor</h1>
            
            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">In simple words, an AC Compressor is the heart of an Air Conditioner.  it is basically a pump. Its main job is to pump the coolant or refrigerant into the air conditioning system. The common belief is that it pumps out cool air. This is a wrong belief. Opposite to this, the reality is that the compressor actually creates heat.<br></p>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><p>It pumps the air conditioning coolant with very high pressure. This coolant is technically known as the refrigerant. As we have learned in Physics the temperature and high pressure has some close relation, the coolant becomes very hot at high pressures. The process of cooling takes place in the a/c system, the details of which will be discussed later in this article.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>The anatomy of AC Compressor</strong>&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>It is made up of mainly two parts. One is the AC Compressor Assembly of clutch and the another is the Compressor itself. The compressor itself has two ports, which are known as the Inlet and the Outlet. Inlet is also known as the "Suction" and outlet is also known as the "Discharge". The suction part has a hole with a larger diameter. It sucks the refrigerant into the compressor, then compresses it under high pressure the pumps out through the outlet. This discharge goes to the condenser. 
</p><p>The inner part of the compressor is very complicated. It has a very complicated mechanism of valves, passages, bearings and some other parts. Different types of pumps are available which are classified as Vane, Piston, Scroll and Rotary type.
</p><p>The compressor clutch:
</p><p>It is made up of three ac compressor parts. 
</p><p>•	Hub
</p><p>•	Pulley
</p><p>•	AC Coil
</p><p>The hub is a round piece of metal is the front part. The pulley is the part on which the belt rides. The coil of the field coil lies under the pulley.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p><strong>The functioning of the coil</strong>
</p><p>Like most of the coils, this coil is also tightly wound with copper wire. It works as an electromagnetic device. When you switch on your a/c electricity or power reaches to it. This magnetizes the coil and in the next step the pulley also. This becomes a larger magnet in itself which pulls the frontal aspect or the face of the hub onto the frontal aspect of the pulley. Because of this process hub engages with the compressor's shaft. This results in the rotation of the compressor's internal components. This starts the suction and discharge process.
</p><p>When the belt turns the clutch and pulley constantly when the engine is switched on. Only when the electricity or the power is turned on the compressor starts working and sends the power to the clutch. There are some safety mechanisms built into the air conditioning system. These are aimed at protecting the compressor if something goes wrong. There are electronics sensors to do this protective work. A low-pressure sensor prevents the compressor clutch from engaging in case the system does not have an adequate amount of refrigerant in the system.
</p><p>The high-pressure sensor cuts the power supply to the clutch in case there is too much high pressure because of less airflow or some internal problem. In most of the latest model vehicles, a/c can be used on Defrost Mode also. This because the a/c not just for cooling only it is for dehumidification also.</p><p><br></p><p>  
</p><p><strong>Something about the air conditioning process</strong></p><p>•	Once A/C is switched on refrigerant is at the low pressure at that moment. After switching it on this refrigerant is sucked by the a/c. It gets converted into high-pressure, hot refrigerant.
</p><p>•	The condenser of a car a/c is located in front of the radiator
</p><p>•	In the next step, the refrigerant travels to the condenser
</p><p>•	Here this hot stuff passes through a network of tubes
</p><p>•	At the condenser fins, air is blown which cools down the refrigerant
</p><p>•	During traveling air is powerful enough to cool it
</p><p>•	To counter any problem at a lower speed at during idle engine fan clutch or cooling ac compressor fans do the work of moving the air across the condenser
</p><p>•	The already cool refrigerant travels from the condenser and reaches the evaporator core
</p><p>•	It has to pass through an expansion device, before reaching the evaporator
</p><p>•	The expansion device could be either an expansion valve or an orifice tube
</p><p>•	The flow here is restricted by this device but allows it to pass through a very small orifice
</p><p>•	Here as the refrigerant passes through this hole in the next step it gets expanded very fast and gets transformed into a very cold liquid
</p><p>•	Now the already cool refrigerant runs into the evaporator core
</p><p>•	This core is situated at the right side
</p><p>•	Now the blower which has a motor connected to it comes into action
</p><p>•	This blower sends the air across the evaporator core
</p><p>•	The warm air starts moving in the evaporator
</p><p>•	The heat is removed from this air and sends it to the refrigerant
</p><p>•	Now the cold air enters the passenger area
</p><p>•	In the end, the heated refrigerant gets out of the evaporator and goes back to its destination the A/C Compressor
</p><p>•	In the same way, the cycle goes on
</p><p>•	The receiver dries and the accumulator:
</p><p>•	Receiver Driers are located on a little higher and the Accumulators are located on the somewhat lower side
</p><p>•	They contain a bag 
</p><p>•	This bag filters debris 
</p><p>•	Also works as a reservoir of refrigerant oil
</p><p>•	An air-conditioning system has only any one of these not both contain a desiccant bag which filters debris and acts as a reservoir for refrigerant oil. An A/C system will have only an accumulator or receiver drier, not both
